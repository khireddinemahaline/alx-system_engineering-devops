HAproxy Cluster:

Redundancy: By configuring the two HAproxy instances as a cluster, you gain redundancy in the load balancing layer. If one HAproxy instance fails, the other can take over, minimizing downtime.
Scalability: You can easily add more HAproxy instances to the cluster to handle increased traffic and improve overall load distribution.

Split Components: by spliting componentes we will gain: 
						multiple recource of hardware
						better managment
						more secure
