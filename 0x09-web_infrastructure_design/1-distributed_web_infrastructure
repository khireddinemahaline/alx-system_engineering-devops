1. additional element (load blancer) : distributing incoming network traffic acroos a group of backend servers, thats help to handel many request in the same time 
2. blancer algorithm (Round Robin) : is the simplest, requests are distributed across the group of servers sequentially
3. the load balancer enabling an active-active 
				Active-Active : whene the two servers are working together to handel request
				Active-Passive : when one server is working until crash and stop, the second server will start handeling request
4. Database primary-replica:
			- Primary(Master) this is the main server responsible for handling all operation (update, insert, deletes) on the database
			- Replicas(slaves) this are sercondry server that keep a copy of a database, this is only for read, 
			you could have multiple replicas for redundancy 
5. the main defrence between Primary node and Replac node is that primary is for write and has limitation in read and the Replica node is for read only


issues are with this infrastructure:
1. SPOF: missing a seconry pwoer supply
2. Security issues 
		-no firewall : without firewall servers are exposed to varios security threats
		-no HTTPS : HTTPS is crucail to encrypting the comminication between the user prowser and the server 
3. with no montoring you will have a lot of issues and lack of preformance during the time, and mybe cause instable or crashed servers
