explain some specifics about this infrastructure:
1. firewall: it's a security phase in the network that allow data to pass or not, and restricts traffic within the private network
2. SSL certificate: it's a digital certificate that authenticates a website's identity and encypted connection, a security protocolo (HTTPS)
3. monetoring clients: machine data analytics for security, operations, and business intelligence (BI) use cases. It helps organizations collect, analyze, and visualize large volumes of data generated by various sources, including: servers, applications, network devices, security tools...

4. monitoring tool collecting data based on sumlogic agents that been installed in the server, these agents colloecting data based on some configration 
then send the data securly to cloud for processing and analyse then visualization 

5.if want to monitor your web server QPS need to:
					1. choose a mentor tool
					2. install mentor agent
					3. configurate the mentor agent

- Load balancers typically offer limited options for configuring SSL termination. You might not have the same level of control over ciphers, certificates, or protocols as you would by terminating SSL on the web server itself.
- haviing one database is a SPOF, if the database is loosed so all system will not working proprly
- having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem : thats would make a lot of problems,
					1. shared recources (CPU, Memory, etc..) might be a problem and cause a SPOF
					2. if hardware system bieng atacked that cause a SPOF for whole system
